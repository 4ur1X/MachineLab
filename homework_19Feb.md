## Skyride Project - Homework 19 February

I used 3D printing to create the motor brackets, pulleys, and arm holders for both sides of the skyride. My initial focus is to fully complete the horizontal skyride first. After that, I can replicate the process for the inclined ropeway. The 3D printing faced delays due to issues with the wheels warping, but by the third attempt, they were perfect. To enable the wheels to rotate, I used a bolt and washer. However, the current challenge is figuring out how to attach these rotating components to the motor. I'm considering 3D printing a pipe to see if that solution is effective. Additionally, the arm attaching component for the non-motor part of the skyride wasn't printed correctly, as it was slightly slanted on one side, requiring me to reprint it. For the base, I'm planning to use wood and incorporate designs through laser cutting.
