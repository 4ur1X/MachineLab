## Skyride Project - Homework 19 February

I used 3D printing to create the motor brackets, pulleys, and arm holders for both sides of the skyride. My plan is to fully complete the horizontal skyride first. After that, I can replicate the process for the inclined ropeway. The 3D printing faced delays due to issues with the wheels warping, but by the third attempt, they were perfect. Currently, the main challenge is determining how to connect the motor to the wheels. I'm considering 3D printing a pipe to see if that solution is effective. For the base, I'm planning to use wood and incorporate designs through laser cutting.
