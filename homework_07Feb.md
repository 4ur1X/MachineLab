## Homework 7th Feb

I'll be working with Liza on the Sky Ride project as part of our class's clock project.

Here's a sketch I drew to give us an idea of our planned design:

![Design](https://github.com/rs7358/MachineLab/blob/main/pictures/penup_20240206_012837.jpg)

We plan to have one horizontal ropeway (marked as 1) in addition to two intersecting slanted ropeways (marked as 2 and 3). When the slanted ropeways are in operation, the horizontal ropeway will not be, and vice versa.

Materials required:
- Motor (continuosly rotating)
- Cardboard
- Hot glue
- LEDs
- Wires
- Threads
- 3D Printer
