## Homework 7th Feb

I'll be working with Liza [(github link)](https://github.com/lizadat/MachineLab/blob/main/homework_07Feb.md) on the Sky Ride project as part of our class's clock project.

Here's a sketch I drew to give us an idea of our planned design:

![Design](https://github.com/rs7358/MachineLab/blob/main/pictures/penup_20240206_012837.jpg)

We plan to have one horizontal ropeway (marked as 1) in addition to two intersecting slanted ropeways (marked as 2 and 3). When the slanted ropeways are in operation, the horizontal ropeway will not be, and vice versa. We will design it such that the cables/carriages do not collide with each other at the intersection points when in operation.

Materials required:
- Motor (continuously rotating but controlled by a program to start and stop based on the detection of whether the motors of the other slanted ropeways are working, with time-based alternating)
- Cardboard (for the structure)
- 3D Printer (for carriage)
- Threads (for ropeway cables)
- Hot glue
- LEDs
- Wires
