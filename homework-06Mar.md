## March 6th Update

Since the wheels turn along with the cable car, and the design of the cable car is complete, I'm going to work on creating a strong foundation that can support the motor and rotating shafts effectively. I'll be using metal, most likely aluminum, for this. Here's the design I have in mind for the two pillars with the motor and shaft, and the other with just the shaft. There will be a base that hides the motor and a tube-shaped cover for the shaft. After I build it, I plan to use a laser cutter to carve patterns into the wood, which will be used to decorate the outside of these pillars.
