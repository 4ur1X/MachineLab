6th March Progress Update

 Since the wheels turn along with the cable car, and the design of the cable car is complete, I'm going to work on creating a sturdy foundation that can support the shafts effectively. I'm thinking of using metal, most likely aluminum, for this. Here's the design I have in mind for the two supportsâ€”one with the motor and shaft, and the other with just the shaft. There will be a base that hides the motor and a tube-shaped cover for the shaft. After I build it, I plan to use a laser cutter to etch patterns into the wood, which will be used to decorate the outside of the supports.
