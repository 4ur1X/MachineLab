Three theme ideas for the class clock

- Quantum Mechanics Theme
- Space Exploration Timeline Clock
- Ancient Greek Theme

Five possible topics to research

- Christiaan Huygens and His Amazing Pendulum Clock: Christiaan Huygens was a genius from the Netherlands who invented the pendulum clock in 1656. This made clocks way more accurate than before. His work is super important for understanding how clocks became a big part of our lives. Check out more about his life and work at the Galileo Project website: http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/huygens.html

- Atomic Clocks: The Super Accurate Clocks: Atomic clocks are the most accurate clocks ever made. They use atoms to measure time, which sounds like science fiction but it's real. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) explains all about atomic clocks on their site: https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division/time-realization/cesium-fountain-atomic-clocks#:~:text=NIST-F3%20and%20NIST-F4%20are%20referred%20to%20as%20fountain,into%20the%20clock%27s%20vacuum%20chamber.

- The Mystery of Stonehenge and Timekeeping: Stonehenge in England is one of the world's oldest mysteries. Some people think it was used as an ancient calendar or to mark seasonal changes. Studying Stonehenge can show us how even thousands of years ago, people were interested in tracking time and seasons. It's a cool way to see how the desire to understand time isn't new. More on this can be found at the official Stonehenge website by English Heritage.

- Leonardo da Vinci's Mechanical Clock Designs: Leonardo da Vinci wasn't just a great artist; he also designed some really interesting mechanical clocks. His designs were way ahead of his time and show how creativity and engineering can come together. Learning about his work helps us see the link between art and science, especially in making timepieces. The Leonardo da Vinci Museum has information on his inventions: Leonardo da Vinci Museum. https://leonardointeractivemuseum.com/en/

- Quartz Crystals in Timekeeping: Quartz crystals are used in quartz watches and clocks to keep time accurately. When electricity is applied to a quartz crystal, it vibrates at a very stable frequency. This topic explores how these vibrations can be converted into electronic signals to measure time. It's a great example of how a natural material can be used in a high-tech application. https://shop.richardsonrfpd.com/docs/rfpd/Timekeeping_with_Quartz_Crystals.pdf
