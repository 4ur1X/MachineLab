The plan was to build a model showing both a straight and an inclined cable line, with a station at the top where passengers can change lines, mimicking a real-life cable car journey. I used two regular DC motors to power the system, one for each line. These motors are firmly attached with hot glue to a cardboard base platform, ensuring stability and preventing any falls. I made the wheels and the cable car from cardboard, but I intend to use 3D-printed versions once I perfect their designs and dimensions. The axles for the wheels, are currently using wooden sticks, are also on my list for 3D printing.

Here's how the prototype looks at the moment.

I encountered some challenges, such as the thread occasionally slipping off the wheel, likely due to uneven cutting of the cardboard and using thick thread. Also, the cable car swings a lot sometimes, probably because it’s lightweight and the cable car hanger is not robust. Going forward, my goal is to refine the design of the cable car and its supports to prevent swinging and ensure they don’t hit the pillars at the ends. This will involve trial and error to determine the most suitable design.
