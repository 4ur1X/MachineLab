## Skyride homework - 26th Feb

I successfully got the pulleys to turn, which moves the cablecar now. On the left side, I attached a motor with a shaft coupler to lengthen the shaft upwards, and at the other end, the pulley rotates because of it. Since the shaft was extended, there was no need to make a support platform for the motor, as it is now directly attached to the base. As you can see, the cablecar goes around smoothly without any problems. Here's a video demonstrating this:

### What will I get done for next week?

Next, I plan to focus on the cablecar, designing it such that it can go around smoothly along the wire and also around the wheel without any obstruction. Once it's done, I'll 3D print it. Also, I'll take the final measurements for the pillars and make the metal (aluminum) versions.
