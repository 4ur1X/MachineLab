## Theme Idea: NYUAD 4 Year Journey

I thought of dividing the 4 years of an NYUAD student's life into 4 separate blocks. Each block can be worked upon by 4 groups.

- Group 1 (year 1 theme): The Beginning
- Group 2 (year 2 theme): Academics
- Group 3 (year 3 theme): Study Away & Cultural Immersion
- Group 4 (year 4 theme): Graduation, Career & Future

Here's some rough sketches I drew for each theme.

- In the first block, we could show acceptance letters floating up from the bottom, kind of like they're bringing good news. At the same time, we can have little planes flying in from all over and gathering over the UAE on a world map. When the planes come to a stop, we'll see a picture of the NYUAD entrance with students arriving with their luggages together, and walking into the campus.
- We could also add sound effects, like the noise of airplanes, happy sounds when the acceptance letters appear, and a "Welcome to NYUAD" greeting when the students show up. For materials, we'd mostly use cardboard or wood prints. The parts that move, like the planes flying in different directions or other elements popping in and out, could use servo motors.
