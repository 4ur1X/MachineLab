## Theme Idea: NYUAD 4 Year Journey

I thought of dividing the 4 different years of an NYUAD student's life intpo 4 separate blocks. Each block can be worked upon by 4 groups.

- Group 1 (year 1 theme): The Beginning
- Group 2 (year 2 theme): Academics
- Group 3 (year 3 theme): Study Away & Cultural Immersion
- Group 4 (year 4 theme): Graduation, Career & Future

Here's come rough sketches I drew for each theme.
