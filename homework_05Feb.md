## Theme Idea: NYUAD 4 Year Journey

**Members: Ronit & Liza**

We thought of dividing the 4 years of an NYUAD student's life into 4 separate blocks. Each block can be worked upon by 4 groups.

- Group 1 (year 1 theme): The Beginning
- Group 2 (year 2 theme): Academics
- Group 3 (year 3 theme): Study Away & Cultural Immersion
- Group 4 (year 4 theme): Graduation, Career & Future

Here's some rough sketches I drew for each theme.

- In the first block, we use the world map as the background and could show acceptance letters floating up from the bottom, kind of like they're bringing good news. At the same time, we can have little planes flying in from all over and gathering over the UAE on a world map. When the planes come to a stop, we'll see a picture of the NYUAD entrance with students arriving with their luggages together, and walking into the campus.
- We could also add sound effects, like the noise of airplanes, happy sounds when the acceptance letters appear, and a "Welcome to NYUAD" greeting when the students show up. For materials, we'd mostly use cardboard or wood prints. The parts that move, like the planes flying in different directions or other elements popping in and out, could use servo motors.

- Year 2 is all about what life is like academically for a student at NYUAD. We could depict this through a "day in the life" concept. Picture a disc that spins (powered by a servo motor) and showcases morning, afternoon, and night. The exact components for each time of day aren't set yet, but the general plan is to show the student's daily routineâ€”from getting ready, attending classes, grabbing a meal at D2, hanging out with friends, studying in the library or their room, to finally heading off to bed. We can add lights to represent nighttime. Plus, we can include other elements like a sun/moon and clouds that change to reflect whether it's day or night.

- It has a carousel that moves side to side in a continuos loop, showing students exploring various countries and cultures around the globe. We could include tiny models of students arriving with their luggage, watching the carousel, and then moving to the right to disappear from view. There's also a plane attached to a stick, making gentle up and down motions as if it's flying. We could play different sounds based on the culture or country being shown on the carousel. And also maybe include small, detailed replicas of iconic landmarks from cities where NYU has global sites, such as the Statue of Liberty (New York), the Eiffel Tower (Paris), the Sydney Opera House (Sydney), and others.
